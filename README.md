# Prototype

# TODO:
* dark mode with sun and moon icon in toolbar
* sidebar
* drag and move
* import from codepen
* export to codepen
* maybe we could implement a service worker for changes to each code box?
* check for errors before triggering render
* randomly display a different codepen as a startup?
* focus on the first editor box on load
* cache up to last 20 prototypes in the browsers local storage
* stylelint
* custom monaco editor theme to look like the original prototype
* load default code then format the boxes afterward
* try resize off the browser, you'll notice that the resize event is still in event
* laggy on the resize stuff (maybe set the style directly on the element and not use a variable)
* do i really need to use an app service to track the resizing or can i use an event emitter
