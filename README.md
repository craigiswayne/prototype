# Prototype

# TODO:
* dark mode with sun and moon icon in toolbar
* sidebar
* drag and move
* import from codepen
* export to codepen
* maybe we could implement a service worker for changes to each code box?
* check for errors before triggering render
* randomly display a different codepen as a startup?
* focus on the first editor box on load
* cache up to last 20 prototypes in the browsers local storage
* stylelint
* custom monaco editor theme to look like the original prototype
* load default code then format the boxes afterward
