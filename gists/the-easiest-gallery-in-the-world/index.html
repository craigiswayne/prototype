      <p>It’s becoming a familiar scenario, even in school parking areas, where
  you narrowly miss being knocked over by an obnoxious 18-year-old driver
  who’s roaring towards the school gates.<br></p>

  <p>I’d like to appeal to the parents of new drivers when I say, “drive like
  a retard and so will your kids.”</p>

  <p>And to the new teenage drivers who have no clue how quick and easy it is
  to land up in a coma (at best) or to kill yourself and others (at worst) by
  doing things that you probably think are cool when driving with your mates:
  &nbsp;YOU ARE NOT COOL. You belong in a school for ants where humans skate
  over ants on skateboards.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you're not one of those sorts of drivers and you do your best to

  <p>And to those of you who aren't yet driving: if you get into a car with
  someone who you suspect is under the influence or someone who you know has
  bad driving habits, DON'T EVER THINK for a second that it's 'not cool' to
  ask the driver to stop the car. Wait until your parents (or an Uber) or
  someone with half a brain can come and get you. (Also tell the driver what
  a loser he or she is once you're out of the car). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now that that’s out of the way let’s chat about how to be a responsible
  (really cool) teen driver who everyone will love and aspire to be like
  because... well because you still have your arms and legs. Thanks to your
  (very cool) safe and mature driving skills, you also care about other
  people on the road. This means that you don’t ever do any of the following
  (seriously UNCOOL) things:</p>

  <p><strong>Speeding</strong> through orange robots (lame).</p>

  <p><strong>Blasting loud music</strong> that stops you from hearing
  important sirens or things happening around you (retard).&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Not wearing a seat belt</strong>&nbsp;(ha...flying teens with
  missing teeth...awesome).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Dangerous <strong>wheel spins and turns</strong>&nbsp;(well, you could
  always haunt Tiger Tiger if you really miss it when you're gone).
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Never checking</strong> a blind spot (because you're too lazy
  and too busy texting).&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Texting</strong> and driving (you're not good at multitasking,
  you're just stupid. Also lame).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Driving too far or <strong>too close to the steering
  wheel</strong>&nbsp;(You're not a Granny, nor are you Snoop Dog, so get
  over it and drive as if driving responsibly means that you'll never have to
  face a hospital bed, a wheel chair or a prison cell for the rest of your
  life).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Be smart, be safe, stay cool and remember: bad driving habits = bad
  accidents.&nbsp;</p>
